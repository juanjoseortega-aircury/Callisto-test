      <h3>Our Products</h3>
      <p>In 2015, Callisto launched “Callisto Campus” to support college sexual assault survivors. It is currently available on <a href="https://www.callistocampus.org/" target="_blank">12 campuses across the United States</a>. Survivors who visit their school's Callisto Campus site are 6x more likely to report their assault.</p>
      <p>In 2020, Callisto will be launching a new product and offering, enabling us to serve more survivors and detect serial perpetrators across many institutions.</p>

        <h3>Callisto Expansion</h3>
        <p>Callisto Expansion is designed to detect serial perpetrators of sexual assault and professional sexual coercion. Survivors can securely and anonymously store information about their perpetrator in Callisto. If more than one survivor names the same perpetrator, they will each be connected to a Callisto Legal Options Counselor—an attorney who, under attorney-client privilege, will help them understand their options for taking action to protect their community (e.g. report to police, report to HR, report to the Title IX Coordinator, go public). These Legal Options Counselors will also help victims of the same perpetrator share information with one another and coordinate their actions.</p>
        <p id="bulletTitle">Callisto Expansion covers:</p>

        <div id="fakeUL">
          <p class="marginIn">
            <span>•</span>
            Sexual assault or rape, including:
          </p>
          <p class="doubleMarginIn">
            <span>°</span>
            Sexual contact without the permission of the survivor
          </p>
          <p class="doubleMarginIn">
            <span>°</span>
            Sexual contact when the survivor was unable to consent
          </p>
          <p class="marginIn">
            <span>•</span>
            Professional sexual coercion, which we define as:
          </p>
          <p class="doubleMarginIn">
            <span>°</span>
            Unwanted sexual overtures from someone with control of influence over the survivor's professional or academic future
          </p>

        <p>How Callisto Expansion works:</p>
        <a href="https://www.callistocampus.org/" id="createAccountLinkCX"><h4>1. Create an account</h4></a>
        <p>At the moment, Callisto Expansion is by invitation-only. Only people who have been invited can create an account. You can get an invitation from a friend who has access to Callisto Expansion, or from your employer, alma mater, union, or other professional network if they partner with Callisto.</p>
        <h4>2. Learn about your options or invite friends</h4>
        <p>Even if you do not enter your perpetrator into Callisto, you can <a href="/survivors-guide.pdf" target="_blank">learn about your options</a> or invite people you know to create accounts.</p>
        <h4>3. Enter your perpetrator into our repeat perpetrator detection system</h4>
        <p>Create a secure entry about your perpetrator. You will be asked to provide uniquely identifiable information about them like their phone number, email address, or social media profiles. You will also be asked for some information about what happened, what state you live in, and your contact information so that—if there is a match—we can connect you to a Legal Options Counselor who is qualified to help. No one at Callisto can see the information you enter. Only you will have access to this entry, unless another survivor names the same perpetrator, in which case you'll be connected to a Legal Options Counselor who will be able to see your entry so they can contact you.</p>
        <h4>4. If a match is found, connect with your Legal Options Counselor</h4>
        <p>We look to see if there is a "match" by comparing the unique perpetrator identifiers (e.g. phone number, email address, or social media profiles) that were put into Callisto. We do this without being able to actually see the data, by using some pretty complex cryptography. If more than one survivor names the same perpetrator, we connect each of them with their own Legal Options Counselor. Legal Options Counselors are attorneys who are licensed to practice in the state the survivor lives in, have training in sexual harassment and assault law, and have training in how to empathetically counsel survivors on their options in a pressure-free way. Legal Options Counselors are not allowed to take the case to court and have no economic incentive to pressure the survivor to do anything. Callisto covers the cost of the Legal Options Counselors—it is a free service to survivors. Legal Options Counselors are not employees of Callisto but have been selected and vetted by Callisto. Legal Options Counselors work with survivors to help survivors understand their options for taking action to protect their communities, the pro and cons of each action, and choose the action that is most likely to help the survivor achieve their ideal outcome (while making sure they understand the risks they are taking).</p>
        <h4>5. Decide which actions, if any, you want to take</h4>
        <p>Based on your conversations with your Legal Options Counselor, decide whether you want to take action to protect your community. This could be privately warning others, confronting your perpetrator, officially reporting your perpetrator, going public, or other action—the options you have will depend on your case. One of your options is to share information with other victims of your same perpetrator—what happened to you might influence what action they want to take, and vice-versa.</p>
        <h4>6. If both survivors consent, coordinate with other victims of the same perpetrator</h4>
        <p>If more than one victim of the same perpetrator—after speaking with their Legal Options Counselor—wants to connect with other victims of the same perpetrator, their Legal Options Counselors will facilitate the sharing of information. This will enable survivors to gather information that might change what action they individually want to take, or to coordinate to take the same action together at the same time.</p>

          <!-- <p>Callisto recognizes that predators who repeatedly commit sexual assault and/or coercion are not limited to any institution or industry. Coverage of widespread sexual misconduct through the #MeToo movement has highlighted the pervasiveness of this issue.</p>

  	<p>In 2018, we expanded our reporting platform to detect repeat perpetrators across different sectors. Callisto for professional industries adapts our unique matching model, providing unique support options to victims:</p>

              <p>An estimated 20% of women, 7% of men, and 24% of trans and gender nonconforming students are sexually assaulted during their college career. An estimated 90% of sexual assaults are committed by repeat perpetrators. Over 85% of college survivors know their assailant, and less than 10% report to their school or the police.</p>
              <p>Callisto Campus allows college sexual assault survivors to learn about their school's and police department's reporting channels, connect with local resources, and take three actions related to recording or reporting their assault (see below). Callisto Campus is available to over 160,000 students across 13 college campuses. Survivors who visit their school’s Callisto Campus website are six times more likely to report their assault and three times more likely to connect with medical or emotional resources. And 15% of survivors entering our matching system (see below) match with another victim of the same assailant, causing them to report simultaneously.</p>
