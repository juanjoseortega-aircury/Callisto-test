        <h3>Why Work at Callisto?</h3>
	<p>Callisto is a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization that creates technology to combat sexual assault, empower survivors, and advance justice.</p>
  <p>Three core values drive our work:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>We are survivor-centered.</b> We support victims by making the reporting process a safe and empowering experience. We rely on trauma-informed design, and we protect user data.</li>
  <br>
	<li><b>We are truth-seeking.</b> We focus on impact. We make decisions through grounded, logical, data-driven arguments. We value a culture of humility where we own our mistakes and learn from them.</li>
  <br>
	<li><b>We are systems-focused.</b> We understand that social justice is complex and requires sophisticated solutions. We see the big picture and play the long game to solve audacious and impactful problems.</li>
  </ul>
	<p>We are a small but powerful team, united in the belief that we can create a more just world. The culture around us is changing rapidly and the demand for Callisto has never been greater. We have expanded beyond our initial work with college campuses to address sexual assault and professional sexual coercion in multiple industries, connecting victims of the same predator to each other and with legal support. </p>
  <p>Thatâ€™s where you come in.</p>
