        <h4>CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER</h4>
        <h5>About Callisto:</h5>
        <p>Callisto is a rapidly growing nonprofit tech startup that has created an online sexual assault reporting and documentation system that helps identify serial sexual predators. The system launched 2.5 years ago on 2 pilot college campuses, and has since grown to 12 colleges and an entertainment industry pilot. Reporting on participating campuses has doubled, assaults have been reported 3 times faster, and 15% of victims have matched with another victim of the same assailant (meaning they were informed that they weren't the only one and connected to the same investigator or legal advisor). In the next year, we will be rapidly expanding to address sexual assault and coercion in multiple industries, connecting victims of the same predator together and with legal support.</p>
        <h5>About The Position:</h5>
        <p>Callisto is seeking a Chief Operating Officer to become the third member of our executive team (joining a CEO and a Chief Product Officer). The COO will oversee a period of rapid growth, ensuring team coordination, seamless flow of information, legal and financial compliance, and a healthy culture. This position is located in San Francisco.</p>
        <h5>Responsibilities:</h5>

            <li><b>People:</b> Oversee recruiting and HR, ensuring that a healthy team culture is created and maintained</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>You Have:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Experience successfully scaling companies from less than 15 to over 40</li>
            <li>A knowledge of or strong desire to learn about tech startup and/or nonprofit operations</li>
            <li>A love of management and processes, but a practical approach to both (sets up processes that will integrate well and be used, not process for process sake)</li>
            <li>Obsessive attention to detail tempered by extraordinary prioritization skills - you notice when things aren’t right but can also backburner when appropriate</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>We'll Give You</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Health, vision and dental insurance</li>
